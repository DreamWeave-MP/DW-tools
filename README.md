** Installation

Typically, Dreamweave-tools should be installed alongside up-to-date copies of the Dreamweave modlists themselves.  
This ensures that your list and your tools should always be synced with one another, with no additional effort or poking around.

The following instructions are *only* For manual users whom are not using Dreamweave's prebaked configs/lists. If you are following a Dreamweave list, please visit the [Sixth House Mod Cache]() for more info.
1. Download the pack for your operating system
2. Extract it to some location on your computer
  - Windows users: *Do not extract it to =Program Files= or any other privileged folder!*
3. OPTIONAL: On all platforms, it's preferable to add the dreamweave-tools folder to your $PATH

That's it! Your tools are ready to go.
